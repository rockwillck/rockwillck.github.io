        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Cycles is a project I started with a friend because we shared chronic, hard-to-treat conditions that we couldn't make heads or tails of.</p>
        <p>I've had migraines for about as long as I can remember, and no neurologist can tell me why. But <i>maybe</i>, I thought, I could find trends and relationships by tracking everything about my life.</p>
        <p>With Cycles, users can log all the patterns in their lives - when they eat, how much they drink, when the headaches come - and the app models future instances and searches for trends between different cycles.</p>
        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>For prediction, Cycles uses an autoregressive multilinear regression model. For finding trends, Cycles searches through pairs between datasets to determine monotonicity.</p>
        <p>Cycles works like an app because it's a PWA, so it can be added to your home screen and launches in app mode rather in the browser.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>We faced struggles with the multiregressive model as we created the app, and the PWA architecture is still buggy on iOS devices.</p>
